# bpimage
bpimage is a simple image editing library. Created mainly so I could explore numpy, image processing, cli development, and extending python with c. 

Basic image transformations, color editing, and convolution filters are implemented. These can be invoked via a cli. 

## Dependencies
 - python (>= 3.10)
 - numpy (>= 1.22)
 - Pillow (>= 9.1.1)
    - used only for io tasks such as loading, saving and previewing images
